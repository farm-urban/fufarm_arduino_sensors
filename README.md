Code for Arduino Sensors

## Spelling

The code is checked for spelling mistakes (happens more often that one might expect). It happens automatically on push to main or when a PR is created.

If you want to run this locally:

```bash
pip install codespell
codespell                   # to check for misspellings
codespell --write-changes   # to automatically fix misspellings
```
